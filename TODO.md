* need to get more metrics tracked, like landing/exit pages ratio, ratio of page URL's, ratio of http-responses
* improve 'traffic sources' metric to show - organic vs search-engine vs referral vs campaign
* js/jquery to refresh dashboard numbers per second (real time mode)
* advanced filtering options
* tracker beacon to track from external apps
